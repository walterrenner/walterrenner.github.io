## Hide email addresses from page source with django

Inspired by [http://csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses#httpredirect](http://csarven.ca/hiding-email-addresses#httpredirect).


    def email_me(request):
        response = HttpResponse("", status=302)
        response['Location'] = "mailto:me@email.com" #
        return response
